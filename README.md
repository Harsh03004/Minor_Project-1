This is our minor project for the Vth semester and it's a 2D hack-and-slasher inspired by games like Dead Cells and Death Gambit. 
It would be an interactive game full of interesting combats, where a player can cast various spells on his/her enemies. 
A player will change according to the environment in which the move set is to be decided on that basis
